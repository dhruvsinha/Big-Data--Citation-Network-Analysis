# Citation Network Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to analyze the interconnections between different fields of research and understand which fields are merging and which are diverging over time. We are using a citation dataset extracted from DBLP, ACM, MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph), which spans from 1936 to early 2022 and contains 5,259,858 papers before cleaning, in JSON format hosted on aminer.com, with a size of approximately 18 GB unprocessed.

We have developed three models to achieve our research objectives:
1. Abstract-Based Clustering: This model is designed to cluster papers based on their abstracts, which can help identify emerging research topics and trends across different fields.
2. Multiclass Text Classification: We used this model to classify papers into different research fields based on their abstracts.
3. Citation count prediction: With this model, we aimed to predict the number of citations a paper would receive based on its title and abstract

Our analysis has revealed that the intersections between computer science and healthcare, econometrics, and meteorology have been increasing over time. This indicates that researchers in these fields are collaborating and sharing their knowledge to solve complex problems that require interdisciplinary approaches.

Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of research fields and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing scientific knowledge.
